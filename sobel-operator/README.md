# Sobel-Operator

This project runs a Sobel Edge Detector using C++ and OpenCV.
A Sobel Edge Operator is a convolutional operator that is able to filter out sharp edges in an image.

OpenCV does have a function that can materialize the Sobel operator, but instead of using that,
I decided to learn the math behind the Sobel convolution operator and made my own C++ code.

I'll upload two folders in this repository and one folder will have 'Type A' of the Sobel operator which is a widely
used convolutional operator that is used. 'Type B' will be a different way to materialize the Sobel operator, but it can be a little bit confusing and a little slower than 'Type A'. 

All of them are open source, so check it out!! :)
